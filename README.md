Title: It Also Stares

Premise: It is a cerebral game in which the character questions his own existence. Things will happen in the game which do not make sense. The main point of the game is that the character is dead, but the bigger questions is: why does it even matter? Did it matter that he was even alive in the first place? 

Themes: I want to incorporate existentialist themes into the game, such as the freedom to make one's choices juxtaposed to the rigid structure inherent in game design, the importance of living as opposed to dying, and if one truly even exists in the first place. The biggest theme of all is: does it even matter what you think of anything? Why should it? . 

Opening: You begin the game in a white environment. It is not a room, per se, but just an empty space. The environment is sterile and lacking any obtrusions. It appears that you are the only one here. You begin to move forward. You have the choice to observe, move, or stay. Why is the choice to stay in a game about moving forward? Because why move at all?  There will be no backstory or setup. Much in the same way that we are born, we are given no warnings. It just happens.

Entities: For the most part, it is only you that exists in the game because you're not too sure about everyone else. The character is introspective, so he will think to himself throughout the game. You will encounter many different people that will never acknowledge you, but you can listen to them speak. They reflect on multiple aspects on living while you merely observe.  

Gameplay: The bulk of it will be the character moving forward and listening to the words of multiple other people that he never actually makes physical or emotional contact with, to represent the type of perosn he is: a coward. I would also like to add some basic puzzle elements that aren't puzzles at all, such as moving a box on a square and a door opening, to once remember that you're somewhat of a ghost and you could've floated through. I'd like to make fun of some basic game design in the process.

Actions: In the white environment, items will be suspended in the air. As you collect items, you begin understand why you're there. Perhaps you're dead, perhaps you're not. Why do you even want to understand what's going on? It's not like it'll make a difference. Actions will include pick up, look around, think, and move. 

Inspirations: Waking Life, Spec Ops: The Line, Sartre's Nausea, and the Myth of Sisyphus. 

Endgame: You are told that you must close your eyes and you'll certainly wake up, for it's all a dream. In the real world, items cannot be suspended in midair. You return home and all seems normal, until you enter your bedroom in which a letter suspends in the air over the bed.
